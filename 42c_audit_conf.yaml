# The audit score is split in two categories, security and data validation. The maximum score
# for security is 30 points and 70 points for data validation. Together, they form
# the overall audit score, maximum 100 points.
#
# With most plugins, you can set the minimum audit score that API definitions must reach
# when you add the task to your CI/CD pipeline.

# You can use the Security and Data validation categories to impose
# additional restrictions on the audited APIs. Just specify a minimum score for one or both of them
# in the 'fail_on' section, as below.
